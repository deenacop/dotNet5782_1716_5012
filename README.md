welcome to my first project 🤩

Hello
We are Deena Glecer and Shira Segal,
second year students in computer science at the Lev Academic Center.
As part of a course that we took, we created this app - ″Drone Strike Delivery″.
At the beginning of creating this app we realized the renewed need for fast and cheap deliveries.
We have created drone strike delivery line by line  and we are proud of the process that drone strike delivery has done.
Of course, there is still a long way to go, but we will continue to operate the system, improve and streamline it.
We will refine the system where possible, add to the existing and fix it where necessary.
″Drone Strike Delivery″-
Drones offer a more cost-effective way to deliver, by reducing shipping times and reducing operating costs .
Through our constant focus on customers, employees and safety, we create new and innovative logistics platforms
for companies and government agencies.
Drones supply is a renewable technology which redefines the traditional shipping industry.
For any comment, inquiry or request we would love to be in touch-

Thank you!
